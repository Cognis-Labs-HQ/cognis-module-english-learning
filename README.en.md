English learning content and provider integration for Cognis Study.

## Features

- 52 alphabet cards and 17 letter combinations with original JSON writing guides; 123 beginner words, 21 grammar/punctuation cards and 45 linked sentences.
- 37 curated verb, copula and adjective paradigms with irregular forms and IPA; hidden supporting forms preserve complete sentence graphs.
- Searchable Free Dictionary lookup, bounded definitions/readings, hidden attribution and host-owned caching.
- Four localized starter decks use Cognis flashcards, favourites and sharing.

## Installation

Install and enable this repository through the Cognis module marketplace. The Study gateway and `study:library:provider` capability are required.

## Architecture

Bootstrap registers providers through ctx, ingests the protected pack, publishes the English descriptor and contributes a removable flow hook. Disabling removes providers; uninstall may retain or cascade-delete the pack through Cognis. No host UI, cache policy or private component implementation is duplicated.
